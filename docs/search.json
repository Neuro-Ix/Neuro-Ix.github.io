I love seeing people use my packages, and I love helping people use them, but I don’t always have the time to give 1:1 help via email. If you post a question somewhere publicly, then other people might give an even better answer; if no one answers in a day or two, then email me the link, so I can answer it publicly and have a link to send the next person with the same question as you. That’s also why I turned this into a blog post – so that I can send others with the same question a pre-written answer!↩︎\nAnonymized and heavily paraphrased.↩︎\nSometimes called training and testing, respectively – rsample uses the analysis/assessment terminology to make it clear that all of this data should be in your training set, and doesn’t touch your final held-out test set.↩︎\nThis is how spatialsample’s autoplot() methods do it, for instance.↩︎"

There’s a number of places in the paper where I more or less say “This line of work has been highly influential in later work”, and then cite every single article I read which cited the original study; this made a bit more sense in the context of “candidacy exam” where I was trying to demonstrate that I had comprehensively surveyed the literature, but isn’t something I’d ever do in published work.↩︎\nIs that key new?

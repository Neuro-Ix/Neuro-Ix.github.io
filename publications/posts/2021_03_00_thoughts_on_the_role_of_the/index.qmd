# Abstract:

Abroad, advanced practice in emergency medicine has had positive effects on populations. In France, following the reform of emergency departments, advanced practice nurses in emergency medicine will become a reality. This new profession raises certain fears. Their contribution must be alongside the patients and in the organisations. For this, patient pathways need to be identified and cooperation between the advanced practice nurses and emergency room doctors must be established.Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.

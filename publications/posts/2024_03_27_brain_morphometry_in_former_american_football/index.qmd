# Abstract:

Exposure to repetitive head impacts (RHIs) in contact sports is associated with neurodegenerative disorders including chronic traumatic encephalopathy (CTE) which currently can be diagnosed only at postmortem. American football players are at higher risk of developing CTE given their exposure to RHIs. One promising approach for diagnosing CTE in vivo is to explore known neuropathological abnormalities at postmortem in living individuals using structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). MRI brain morphometry was evaluated in 170 male former American football players ages 45-74 years (n = 114 professional; n = 56 college) and 54 same-age unexposed asymptomatic male controls (n = 58 age range 45-74). Cortical thickness and volume of regions of interest were selected based on established CTE pathology findings and were assessed using FreeSurfer. Group differences and interactions with age and exposure factors were evaluated using a generalized least squares model. A separate logistic regression and independent multinomial model were performed to predict each Traumatic Encephalopathy Syndrome (TES) diagnosis core clinical features and provisional level of certainty for CTE pathology using brain regions of interest. Former college and professional American football players (combined) showed significant cortical thickness and/or volume reductions compared to unexposed asymptomatic controls in the hippocampus amygdala entorhinal cortex parahippocampal gyrus insula temporal pole and superior frontal gyrus. Post-hoc analyses identified group-level differences between former professional players and unexposed asymptomatic controls in the hippocampus amygdala entorhinal cortex parahippocampal gyrus insula and superior frontal gyrus. Former college players showed significant volume reductions in the hippocampus amygdala and superior frontal gyrus compared to the unexposed asymptomatic controls. We did not observe age-by-group interactions for brain morphometric measures. Interactions between morphometry and exposure measures were limited to a single significant positive association between the age of first exposure to organized tackle football and right insular volume. We found no significant relationship between brain morphometric measures and the TES diagnosis core clinical features and provisional level of certainty for CTE pathology outcomes. These findings suggest that MRI morphometrics detects abnormalities in individuals with a history of RHI exposure that resemble the anatomic distribution of pathological findings from postmortem CTE studies. The lack of findings associating MRI measures with exposure metrics (except for one significant relationship) or TES diagnosis and core clinical features suggests that brain morphometry must be complemented by other types of measures to characterize individuals with RHIs.(c) The Author(s) 2024.

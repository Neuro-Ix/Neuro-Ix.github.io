# Abstract:

A Henneguya sp., morphologically resembling Henneguya nyongensis Fomena & Bouix, 1996, was isolated from the gills of Peter's elephantnose fish, Gnathonemus petersii Gunther, imported from Nigeria. Plasmodia were located between lamellae and within the gill epithelium, often leading to lamellar fusion. Although slightly smaller, the myxospores from these fish were morphologically consistent with H. nyongensis. In valvular view, spores are elongate, pyriform with a rounded posterior and tapering caudal processes. Myxospore bodies are 9.6-12.3 (mean 11.2) um long and 4.0-4.7 (mean 4.3) um wide. Polar capsules are pyriform, elongate, 4.5-5.2 (4.7) um long and 1.3-1.6 (1.4) um wide, with a characteristic neck-like structure at the apical end. Sequence generated for the 18S small subunit rRNA gene did not directly match any sequences available on GenBank, but demonstrated 91% nucleotide similarity to an unpublished Henneguya sp. infecting Mormyrus kannume Forsskal. Herein, the description of H. nyongensis is supplemented with new data on histopathology, molecular characterisation, and expanded host and geographical range.

# Abstract:

Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is a potentially unique risk factor for auditory hallucinations (AH), but few studies have examined the moderating effects of sex or the association of CSA with limbic gray matter volume (GMV) in transdiagnostic samples of people with psychotic disorders. Here we found that people with psychotic disorders reported higher levels of all surveyed maltreatment types (e.g., physical abuse) than healthy controls, but people with psychotic disorders with AH (n = 41) reported greater CSA compared to both those without AH (n = 37; t = -2.21, p = .03) and controls (n = 37; t = -3.90, p < .001). Among people with psychosis, elevated CSA was most pronounced among females with AH (sex x AH status: F = 4.91, p = .009), held controlling for diagnosis, medications, and other maltreatment (F = 3.88, p = .02), and correlated with the current severity of AH (r = .26, p = .03) but not other symptoms (p's > .16). Greater CSA among patients related to larger GMV of the left amygdala accounting for AH status, diagnosis, medications, and other maltreatment (t = 2.12, p = .04). Among people with psychosis, females with AH may represent a unique subgroup with greater CSA. Prospective high-risk studies integrating multiple measures of maltreatment and brain structure/function may help elucidate the mechanisms linking CSA with amygdala alterations and AH.(c) 2022.

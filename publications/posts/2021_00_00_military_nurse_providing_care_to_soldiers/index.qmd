# Abstract:

Armed forces nurses are selected and trained to intervene on the frontline in the minutes following an injury. Their training and their experience enable them to perform all emergency technical procedures as well as specific procedures performed in war situations. They are prepared to work with personnel from all backgrounds and to integrate pluriprofessional teams with whom they have never previously worked.Copyright (c) 2021 Elsevier Masson SAS.
